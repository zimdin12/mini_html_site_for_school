    A computer keyboard is a typewriter-style device[1] which uses an arrangement of buttons or keys to act as
    mechanical
    levers or electronic switches. Following the decline of punch cards and paper tape, interaction via
    teleprinter-style keyboards became the main input method for computers.
</p>
<p>
    Keyboard keys (buttons) typically have characters engraved or printed on them,[2] and each press of a key typically
    corresponds to a single written symbol. However, producing some symbols may require pressing and holding several
    keys simultaneously or in sequence.[3] While most keyboard keys produce letters, numbers or signs (characters),
    other keys or simultaneous key presses can produce actions or execute computer commands.
</p>
<p>
    In normal usage, the keyboard is used as a text entry interface for typing text and numbers into a word processor,
    text editor or any other program. In a modern computer, the interpretation of key presses is generally left to the
    software. A computer keyboard distinguishes each physical key from every other key and reports all key presses to
    the controlling software. Keyboards are also used for computer gaming — either regular keyboards or keyboards with
    special gaming features, which can expedite frequently used keystroke combinations.
</p>
<p>
    A keyboard is also used to give commands to the operating system of a computer, such as Windows' Control-Alt-Delete
    combination. Although on Pre-Windows 95 Microsoft operating systems this forced a re-boot, now it brings up a system
    security options screen.[4][5]
